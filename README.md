## Topic: Previewing the Presidential Election with a Youtube Web Crawler.
Search Parameters: 
1. "Presidential Election"
2. "Presidential Election" Trump"
3. "Presidential Election Biden"


For this project, I wanted to compare what the Youtube search results would be for the different canidates for the upcoming Presidential election. I think that this is very relevant as the election is coming up and it is important to know what people are saying about both of the canidates. I think this is also very prevelant right now, as the Republican primarys that are going on can allow us to look at how the country as a whole is viewing both of these canidates as this process continues.

In order to draw a successful comparison, I decided to have 3 datasets and maps. One of these represents a control, another represents Trump, and the third represents Biden.
